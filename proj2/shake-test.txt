At once, good night:Stand not upon the order of your going,But go at once.Though you untie the winds and let them fightAgainst the churches;though the yesty wavesConfound and swallow navigation up;Though bladed corn be lodged and trees blown down;Though castles topple on their warders’ heads;Though palaces and pyramids do slopeTheir heads to their foundations;though the treasureOf nature’s germens tumble all together,Even till destruction sicken;answer me…Show his eyes, and grieve his heart;Come like shadows, so depart!Out, damned spot!Out, I say!
