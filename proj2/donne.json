["﻿Mark but this flea, and mark in this,","How little that which thou deniest me is;","It sucked me first, and now sucks thee,","And in this flea our two bloods mingled be.","Thou know’st that this cannot be said","A sin, nor shame, nor loss of maidenhead;","Yet this enjoys before it woo;","And pampered swells with one blood made of two,","And this, alas, is more than we would do!","O stay, three lives in one flea spare,","Where we almost, yea, more than married are.","This flea is you and I, and this","Our marriage bed, and marriage temple is.","Though parents grudge, and you, we’re met,","And cloistered in these living walls of jet.","Though use make you apt to kill me,","Let not to that self-murder added be,","And sacrilege, three sins in killing three.","Cruel and sudden, hast thou since","Purpled thy nail in blood of innocence?","Wherein could this flea guilty be,","Except in that drop which it sucked from thee?","Yet thou triumph’st, and say’st that thou","Find’st not thyself nor me the weaker now.","’Tis true; then learn how false fears be;","Just so much honour, when thou yield’st to me,","Will waste, as this flea’s death took life from thee.","I wonder by my troth, what thou and I","Did, till we loved? Were we not weaned till then?","But sucked on country pleasures, childishly?","Or snorted we in the Seven Sleepers’ den?","‘Twas so; but this, all pleasures’ fancies be;","If ever any beauty I did see,","Which I desired, and got, ’twas but a dream of thee.","And now good-morrow to our waking souls,","Which watch not one another out of fear;","For love all love of other sights controls,","And makes one little room an everywhere.","Let sea-discoverers to new worlds have gone;","Let maps to other, worlds on worlds have shown;","Let us possess one world;

we two being one, are it;","So, to one neutral thing both sexes fit.","We die and rise the same, and prove","Mysterious by this love.","We can die by it, if not live by love,","And if unfit for tomb or hearse","Our legend be, it will be fit for verse;","And if no piece of chronicle we prove,","We’ll build in sonnets pretty rooms;","As well a well-wrought urn becomes","The greatest ashes, as half-acre tombs,","And by these hymns, all shall approve","Us canonized for love;","And thus invoke us, ‘You, whom reverend love","Made one another’s hermitage;","You, to whom love was peace, that now is rage;","Who did the whole world’s soul contract, and drove","Into the glasses of your eyes;","So made such mirrors, and such spies,","That they did all to you epitomize –","Countries, towns, courts beg from above","A pattern of your love.’","I am two fools, I know,","For loving, and for saying so","In whining poetry;","But where’s that wise man, that would not be I,","If she would not deny?","Then as th’ earth’s inward narrow crooked lanes","Do purge sea water’s fretful salt away,","I thought, if I could draw my pains","Through rhyme’s vexation, I should them allay.","Grief brought to numbers cannot be so fierce,","For he tames it, that fetters it in verse.","But when I have done so,","Some man, his art and voice to show,","Doth set and sing my pain;","And, by delighting many, frees again","Grief, which verse did restrain.","To love and grief tribute of verse belongs,","But not of such as pleases when ’tis read.","Both are increasèd by such songs,","For both their triumphs so are published,","And I, which was two fools, do so grow three.","Who are a little wise, the best fools be.","If yet I have not all thy love,","Dear, I shall never have it all;","I cannot breathe one other sigh, to move,","Nor can intreat one other tear to fall;","And all my treasure, which should purchase thee,","Sighs, tears, and oaths, and letters I have spent;","Yet no more can be due to me,","Than at the bargain made was meant.","If then thy gift of love were partial,","That some to me, some should to others fall,","Dear, I shall never have thee all.","Or if then thou gavest me all,","All was but all, which thou hadst then;","But if in thy heart since there be or shall","New love created be by other men,","Which have their stocks entire, and can in tears,","In sighs, in oaths, and letters, outbid me,","This new love may beget new fears,","For this love was not vowed by thee.","And yet it was, thy gift being general;","The ground, thy heart, is mine; what ever shall","Grow there, dear, I should have it all.","Yet I would not have all yet.","He that hath all can have no more;","And since my love doth every day admit","New growth, thou shouldst have new rewards in store;","Thou canst not every day give me thy heart,","If thou canst give it, then thou never gav’st it;","Love’s riddles are, that though thy heart depart,","It stays at home, and thou with losing sav’st it;","But we will have a way more liberal,","Than changing hearts, to join them;

That’s the worst disease of love,","The poor, the foul, the false, love can","Admit, but not the busied man.","He which hath business, and makes love, doth do","Such wrong, as when a married man doth woo.","All kings, and all their favourites,","All glory of honours, beauties, wits,","The sun it self, which makes time, as they pass,","Is elder by a year now than it was","When thou and I first one another saw.","All other things to their destruction draw,","Only our love hath no decay;","This no to-morrow hath, nor yesterday;","Running it never runs from us away,","But truly keeps his first, last, everlasting day.","Two graves must hide thine and my corse;","If one might, death were no divorce.","Alas! as well as other princes, we","– Who prince enough in one another be –","Must leave at last in death these eyes and ears,","Oft fed with true oaths, and with sweet salt tears;","But souls where nothing dwells but love","– All other thoughts being inmates – then shall prove","This or a love increasèd there above,","When bodies to their graves, souls from their graves remove.","And then we shall be throughly blest;","But now no more than all the rest.","Here upon earth we’re kings, and none but we","Can be such kings, nor of such subjects be.","Who is so safe as we, where none can do","Treason to us, except one of us two?","True and false fears let us refrain,","Let us love nobly, and live, and add again","Years and years unto years, till we attain","To write threescore;

we are","Th’ intelligences, they the spheres.","We owe them thanks, because they thus","Did us, to us, at first convey,","Yielded their senses’ force to us,","Nor are dross to us, but allay.","On man heaven’s influence works not so,","But that it first imprints the air;","For soul into the soul may flow,","Though it to body first repair.","As our blood labours to beget","Spirits, as like souls as it can;","Because such fingers need to knit","That subtle knot, which makes us man;","So must pure lovers’ souls descend","To affections, and to faculties,","Which sense may reach and apprehend,","Else a great prince in prison lies.","To our bodies turn we then, that so","Weak men on love revealed may look;","Love’s mysteries in souls do grow,","But yet the body is his book.","And if some lover, such as we,","Have heard this dialogue of one,","Let him still mark us, he shall see","Small change when we’re to bodies gone.","I long to talk with some old lover’s ghost,","Who died before the god of love was born.","I cannot think that he, who then loved most,","Sunk so low as to love one which did scorn.","But since this god produced a destiny,","And that vice-nature, custom, lets it be,","I must love her that loves not me.","Sure, they which made him god, meant not so much,","Nor he in his young godhead practised it.","But when an even flame two hearts did touch","His office was indulgently to fit","Actives to passives. Correspondency","Only his subject was; it cannot be","Love, till I love her, who loves me.","But every modern god will now extend","His vast prerogative as far as Jove.","To rage, to lust, to write to, to commend,","All is the purlieu of the god of love.","Oh, were we wakened by this tyranny","To ungod this child again, it could not be","I should love her, who loves not me.","Rebel and atheist too, why murmur I,","As though I felt the worst that love could do?","Love might make me leave loving, or might try","A deeper plague, to make her love me too;","Which, since she loves before, I’m loth to see.","Falsehood is worse than hate; and that must be,","If she whom I love, should love me.","To what a cumbersome unwieldiness","And burdenous corpulence my love had grown,","But that I did, to make it less,","And keep it in proportion,","Give it a diet, made it feed upon","That which love worst endures, discretion","Above one sigh a day I allowed him not,","Of which my fortune, and my faults had part;","And if sometimes by stealth he got","A she sigh from my mistress’ heart,","And thought to feast upon that, I let him see","‘Twas neither very sound, nor meant to me.","If he wrung from me a tear, I brined it so","With scorn and shame, that him it nourished not;","If he sucked hers, I let him know","’Twas not a tear which he had got;","His drink was counterfeit, as was his meat;","For eyes, which roll towards all, weep not, but sweat.","Whatever he would dictate I writ that,","But burnt her letters when she writ to me;","And if that favour made him fat,","I said, “If any title be","Conveyed by this, ah, what doth it avail,","To be the fortieth name in an entail?”","Thus I reclaimed my buzzard love, to fly","At what, and when, and how, and where I choose.","Now negligent of sports I lie,","And now, as other falconers use,","I spring a mistress, swear, write, sigh, and weep;","And the game killed, or lost, go talk or sleep.","Before I sigh my last gasp, let me breathe,","Great Love, some legacies; I here bequeath","Mine eyes to Argus, if mine eyes can see;","If they be blind, then, Love, I give them thee;","My tongue to Fame; to ambassadors mine ears;","To women, or the sea, my tears;","Thou, Love, hast taught me heretofore","By making me serve her who had twenty more,","That I should give to none, but such as had too much before.","My constancy I to the planets give;","My truth to them who at the court do live;","My ingenuity and openness,","To Jesuits; to buffoons my pensiveness;","My silence to any, who abroad hath been;","My money to a Capuchin :","Thou, Love, taught’st me, by appointing me","To love there, where no love received can be,","Only to give to such as have an incapacity.","My faith I give to Roman Catholics;","All my good works unto the Schismatics","Of Amsterdam; my best civility","And courtship to an University;","My modesty I give to soldiers bare;","My patience let gamesters share :","Thou, Love, taught’st me, by making me","Love her that holds my love disparity,","Only to give to those that count my gifts indignity.","I give my reputation to those","Which were my friends; mine industry to foes;","To schoolmen I bequeath my doubtfulness;","My sickness to physicians, or excess;","To nature all that I in rhyme have writ;","And to my company my wit:","Thou, Love, by making me adore","Her, who begot this love in me before,","Taught’st me to make, as though I gave, when I do but restore.","To him for whom the passing-bell next tolls,","I give my physic books; my written rolls","Of moral counsels I to Bedlam give;","My brazen medals unto them which live","In want of bread; to them which pass among","All foreigners, mine English tongue:","Though, Love, by making me love one","Who thinks her friendship a fit portion","For younger lovers, dost my gifts thus disproportion.","Therefore I’ll give no more, but I’ll undo","The world by dying, because love dies too.","Then all your beauties will be no more worth","Than gold in mines, where none doth draw it forth;","And all your graces no more use shall have,","Than a sun-dial in a grave :","Thou, Love, taught’st me by making me","Love her who doth neglect both me and thee,","To invent, and practise this one way, to annihilate all three.","Whoever comes to shroud me, do not harm,","Nor question much,","That subtle wreath of hair, which crowns my arm;","The mystery, the sign, you must not touch;","For ’tis my outward soul,","Viceroy to that, which then to heaven being gone,","Will leave this to control","And keep these limbs, her provinces, from dissolution.","For if the sinewy thread my brain lets fall","Through every part","Can tie those parts, and make me one of all,","Those hairs which upward grew, and strength and art","Have from a better brain,","Can better do’t; except she meant that I","By this should know my pain,","As prisoners then are manacled, when they’re condemned to die.","Whate’er she meant by it, bury it with me,","For since I am","Love’s martyr, it might breed idolatry,","If into other hands these relics came.","As ’twas humility","To afford to it all that a soul can do,","So ’tis some bravery,","That since you would have none of me, I bury some of you.","Little think’st thou, poor flower,","Whom I have watched six or seven days,","And seen thy birth, and seen what every hour","Gave to thy growth, thee to this height to raise,","And now dost laugh and triumph on this bough,","Little think’st thou,","That it will freeze anon, and that I shall","To-morrow find thee fallen, or not at all.","Little think’st thou, poor heart,","That labour’st yet to nestle thee,","And think’st by hovering here to get a part","In a forbidden or forbidding tree,","And hopest her stiffness by long siege to bow,","Little think’st thou","That thou to-morrow, ere the sun doth wake,","Must with the sun and me a journey take.","But thou, which lov’st to be","Subtle to plague thyself, wilt say,","Alas, if you must go, what’s that to me?","Here lies my business, and here I will stay","You go to friends, whose love and means present","Various content","To your eyes, ears, and taste, and every part;","If then your body go, what need your heart?","Well then, stay here; but know,","When thou hast stayed and done thy most,","A naked thinking heart, that makes no show,","Is to a woman but a kind of ghost.","How shall she know my heart; or having none,","Know thee for one?","Practice may make her know some other part;","But take my word, she doth not know a hear","Meet me in London, then,","Twenty days hence, and thou shalt see","Me fresher and more fat, by being with men,","Than if I had stayed still with her and thee.","For God’s sake, if you can, be you so too;","I will give you","There to another friend, whom we shall find","As glad to have my body as my mind.","Upon this Primrose hill,","Where, if heaven would distil","A shower of rain, each several drop might go","To his own primrose, and grow manna so;","And where their form, and their infinity","Make a terrestrial galaxy,","As the small stars do in the sky;","I walk to find a true love; and I see","That ’tis not a mere woman, that is she,","But must or more or less than woman be.","Yet know I not, which flower","I wish; a six, or four;","For should my true-love less than woman be,","She were scarce anything; and then, should she","Be more than woman, she would get above","All thought of sex, and think to move","My heart to study her, and not to love.","Both these were monsters; since there must reside","Falsehood in woman, I could more abide,","She were by art, than nature falsified.","Live, primrose, then, and thrive","With thy true number five;","And, woman, whom this flower doth represent,","With this mysterious number be content;","Ten is the farthest number; if half ten","Belongs to each woman, then","Each woman may take half us men;","Or – if this will not serve their turn – since all","Numbers are odd, or even, and they fall","First into five, women may take us all.","When my grave is broke up again","Some second guest to entertain,","– For graves have learned that woman-head,","To be to more than one a bed –","And he that digs it, spies","A bracelet of bright hair about the bone,","Will he not let us alone,","And think that there a loving couple lies,","Who thought that this device might be some way","To make their souls at the last busy day","Meet at this grave, and make a little stay?","If this fall in a time, or land,","Where mass-devotion doth command,","Then he that digs us up will bring","Us to the bishop or the king,","To make us relics; then","Thou shalt be a Mary Magdalen, and I","A something else thereby;","All women shall adore us, and some men.","And, since at such time miracles are sought,","I would have that age by this paper taught","What miracles we harmless lovers wrought.","First we loved well and faithfully,","Yet knew not what we loved, nor why;","Difference of sex we never knew,","No more than guardian angels do;","Coming and going we","Perchance might kiss, but not between those meals;","Our hands ne’er touched the seals,","Which nature, injured by late law, sets free.","These miracles we did; but now alas,","All measure, and all language, I should pass,","Should I tell what a miracle she was.","When I am dead, and doctors know not why,","And my friends’ curiosity","Will have me cut up to survey each part,","When they shall find your picture in my heart,","You think a sudden damp of love","Will through all their senses move,","And work on them as me, and so prefer","Your murder to the name of massacre,","Poor victories; but if you dare be brave,","And pleasure in your conquest have,","First kill th’ enormous giant, your Disdain;","And let th’ enchantress Honour, next be slain;","And like a Goth and Vandal rise,","Deface records and histories","Of your own arts and triumphs over men,","And without such advantage kill me then,","For I could muster up, as well as you,","My giants, and my witches too,","Which are vast Constancy and Secretness;","But these I neither look for nor profess;","Kill me as woman, let me die","As a mere man; do you but try","Your passive valour, and you shall find then,","Naked you have odds enough of any man.","She’s dead; and all which die","To their first elements resolve;","And we were mutual elements to us,","And made of one another.","My body then doth hers involve,","And those things whereof I consist hereby","In me abundant grow, and burdenous,","And nourish not, but smother.","My fire of passion, sighs of air,","Water of tears, and earthly sad despair,","Which my materials be,","But near worn out by love’s security,","She, to my loss, doth by her death repair.","And I might live long wretched so,","But that my fire doth with my fuel grow.","Now, as those active kings","Whose foreign conquest treasure brings,","Receive more, and spend more, and soonest break,","This – which I am amazed that I can speak –","This death, hath with my store","My use increased.","And so my soul, more earnestly released,","Will outstrip hers; as bullets flown before","A latter bullet may o’ertake, the powder being more.","Thou art not so black as my heart,","Nor half so brittle as her heart, thou art;","What would’st thou say? Shall both our properties by thee be spoke,","– ‘Nothing more endless, nothing sooner broke?’","Marriage rings are not of this stuff;","Oh, why should ought less precious, or less tough","Figure our loves? Except in thy name thou have bid it say,","– ‘I’m cheap, and nought but fashion; fling me away.’","Yet stay with me since thou art come,","Circle this finger’s top, which didst her thumb;","Be justly proud, and gladly safe, that thou dost dwell with me;","She that, O, broke her faith, would soon break thee!","I never stooped so low, as they","Which on an eye, cheek, lip, can prey;","Seldom to them which soar no higher","Than virtue, or the mind to admire.","For sense and understanding may","Know what gives fuel to their fire;","My love, though silly, is more brave;","For may I miss, whene’er I crave,","If I know yet what I would have.","If that be simply perfectest,","Which can by no way be expressed","But negatives, my love is so.","To all, which all love, I say no.","If any who deciphers best,","What we know not, ourselves, can know,","Let him teach me that nothing. This","As yet my ease and comfort is,","Though I speed not, I cannot miss.","Take heed of loving me;","At least remember, I forbade it thee;","Not that I shall repair my unthrifty waste","Of breath and blood, upon thy sighs and tears,","By being to thee then what to me thou wast;","But so great joy our life at once outwears.","Then, lest thy love by my death frustrate be,","If thou love me, take heed of loving me.","Take heed of hating me,","Or too much triumph in the victory;","Not that I shall be mine own officer,","And hate with hate again retaliate;","But thou wilt lose the style of conqueror,","If I, thy conquest, perish by thy hate.","Then, lest my being nothing lessen thee,","If thou hate me, take heed of hating me.","Yet love and hate me too;","So these extremes shall ne’er their office do;","Love me, that I may die the gentler way;","Hate me, because thy love’s too great for me;","Or let these two, themselves, not me, decay;","So shall I live thy stage, not triumph be.","Lest thou thy love and hate, and me undo,","O let me live, yet love and hate me too.","So, so, break off this last lamenting kiss,","Which sucks two souls, and vapours both away;","Turn, thou ghost, that way, and let me turn this,","And let ourselves benight our happiest day.","We ask none leave to love; nor will we owe","Any so cheap a death as saying, “Go.”","Go; and if that word have not quite killed thee,","Ease me with death, by bidding me go too.","Or, if it have, let my word work on me,","And a just office on a murderer do.","Except it be too late, to kill me so,","Being double dead, going, and bidding, go.","For my first twenty years, since yesterday,","I scarce believed thou couldst be gone away;","For forty more I fed on favours past,","And forty on hopes that thou wouldst they might last;","Tears drowned one hundred, and sighs blew out two;","A thousand, I did neither think nor do,","Or not divide, all being one thought of you;","Or in a thousand more, forgot that too.","Yet call not this long life; but think that I","Am, by being dead, immortal; can ghosts die?","No lover saith, I love, nor any other","Can judge a perfect lover;","He thinks that else none can or will agree,","That any loves but he;","I cannot say I loved, for who can say","He was killed yesterday?","Love with excess of heat, more young than old,","Death kills with too much cold;","We die but once, and who loved last did die,","He that saith, twice, doth lie;","For though he seem to move, and stir a while,","It doth the sense beguile.","Such life is like the light which bideth yet","When the life’s light is set,","Or like the heat which fire in solid matter","Leaves behind, two hours after.","Once I loved and died; and am now become","Mine epitaph and tomb;","Here dead men speak their last, and so do I;","Love-slain, lo, here I die!","Soul’s joy, now I am gone,","And you alone,","– Which cannot be,","Since I must leave myself with thee,","And carry thee with me –","Yet when unto our eyes","Absence denies","Each other’s sight,","And makes to us a constant night,","When others change to light;","O give no way to grief,","But let belief","Of mutual love","This wonder to the vulgar prove,","Our bodies, not we, move.","Let not thy wit beweep","Words but sense deep;","For when we miss","By distance our hope’s joining bliss,","Even then our souls shall kiss;","Fools have no means to meet,","But by their feet;","Why should our clay","Over our spirits so much sway,","To tie us to that way?","O give no way to grief, &c.","Whilst yet to prove","I thought there was some deity in love,","So did I reverence, and gave","Worship; as atheists at their dying hour","Call, what they cannot name, an unknown power,","As ignorantly did I crave.","Thus when","Things not yet known are coveted by men,","Our desires give them fashion, and so","As they wax lesser, fall, as they size, grow.","But, from late fair,","His highness sitting in a golden chair,","Is not less cared for after three days","By children, than the thing which lovers so","Blindly admire, and with such worship woo;","Being had, enjoying it decays;","And thence,","What before pleased them all, takes but one sense,","And that so lamely, as it leaves behind","A kind of sorrowing dullness to the mind.","Ah cannot we,","As well as cocks and lions, jocund be","After such pleasures, unless wise","Nature decreed (since each such act, they say,","Diminisheth the length of life a day)","This; as she would man should despise","The sport,","Because that other curse of being short,","And only for a minute made to be","Eager, desires to raise posterity.","Since so, my mind","Shall not desire what no man else can find;","I’ll no more dote and run","To pursue things which had endamaged me;","And when I come where moving beauties be,","As men do when the summer’s sun","Grows great,","Though I admire their greatness, shun their heat.","Each place can afford shadows; if all fail,","‘Tis but applying worm-seed to the tail.","Stand still, and I will read to thee","A lecture, Love, in Love’s philosophy.","These three hours that we have spent,","Walking here, two shadows went","Along with us, which we ourselves produced.","But, now the sun is just above our head,","We do those shadows tread,","And to brave clearness all things are reduced.","So whilst our infant loves did grow,","Disguises did, and shadows, flow","From us and our cares; but now ’tis not so.","That love hath not attained the highest degree,","Which is still diligent lest others see.","Except our loves at this noon stay,","We shall new shadows make the other way.","As the first were made to blind","Others, these which come behind","Will work upon ourselves, and blind our eyes.","If our loves faint, and westwardly decline,","To me thou, falsely, thine","And I to thee mine actions shall disguise.","The morning shadows wear away,","But these grow longer all the day;","But O! Love’s day is short, if love decay.","Love is a growing, or full constant light,","And his short minute, after noon, is night."]
