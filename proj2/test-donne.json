["﻿Mark but this flea, and mark in this,","How little that which thou deniest me is;","It sucked me first, and now sucks thee,","And in this flea our two bloods mingled be.","Thou know’st that this cannot be said","A sin, nor shame, nor loss of maidenhead;","Yet this enjoys before it woo;","And pampered swells with one blood made of two,","And this, alas, is more than we would do!","O stay, three lives in one flea spare,","Where we almost, yea, more than married are.","This flea is you and I, and this","Our marriage bed, and marriage temple is.","Though parents grudge, and you, we’re met,","And cloistered in these living walls of jet.","Though use make you apt to kill me,","Let not to that self-murder added be,","And sacrilege, three sins in killing three.","Cruel and sudden, hast thou since","Purpled thy nail in blood of innocence?","Wherein could this flea guilty be,","Except in that drop which it sucked from thee?","Yet thou triumph’st, and say’st that thou","Find’st not thyself nor me the weaker now.","’Tis true; then learn how false fears be;","Just so much honour, when thou yield’st to me,","Will waste, as this flea’s death took life from thee.","I wonder by my troth, what thou and I","Did, till we loved? Were we not weaned till then?","But sucked on country pleasures, childishly?","Or snorted we in the Seven Sleepers’ den?","‘Twas so; but this, all pleasures’ fancies be;","If ever any beauty I did see,","Which I desired, and got, ’twas but a dream of thee.","And now good-morrow to our waking souls,","Which watch not one another out of fear;","For love all love of other sights controls,","And makes one little room an everywhere."]
